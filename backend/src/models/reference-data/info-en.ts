From the third day after the accident, you receive a daily allowance of 80 per cent of your salary. You receive this allowance regardless of whether the accident occurred at work (occupational accident) or during your time off work (non-occupational accident). The only exception arises if you are an employee working less than eight hours a week; in this case, only occupational accidents and accidents that occur on your way to work are covered. The allowance is paid for a fixed period.  Ask your employer about the conditions that apply in your case. Please note: if your doctor decides that you are unable to work after an accident, you are not supposed to work. If you do work, the insurance company can file a claim against you and demand you reimburse the benefits you received.",
