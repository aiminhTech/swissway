3. Give your living will to a close friend or family member, or to your family doctor. You can also tell them where your treatment team can find the document if they need it.
4. Keep a note in your wallet about your living will and where it is kept.

Do not hesitate to get advice on completing the form. The doctor treating you will be able to help, for example. If decisions have to be made, a clear directive setting out your wishes carries greater weight, and raises fewer questions about what those wishes are.

Review your living will regularly and amend it if necessary. The FMH recommends checking it every couple of years. Do not forget to date and sign the new version.

Your employer is obliged to provide you with a salary certificate each year and usually sends it to you before the end of January. If you had more than one job at any time or if you changed employers during the year in question, you will receive a certificate for each job.

The salary certificate is the most important document you need for completing your tax return. In several cantons, employers have to send a copy directly to the tax authorities. As an employee, you only need to attach a salary certificate to your tax return if you work for an employer outside your canton or if required by the competent tax authority.`,

Procedure:
Write out your will entirely by hand; it must contain the following elements:

- The heading Â«WillÂ»
- Your first name(s), surname, date of birth and, if applicable, place of origin.
- Your wishes (see above: What do I want to include in my will?)
- If you want to appoint an executor: the name of the person who will deal with the distribution of your estate and execute your will. This can be a person you trust (one of your heirs or another person), a lawyer or notary, or even a bank or accountancy firm. It can be helpful to appoint an executor in advance, as this can speed up the distribution of the estate and helps to avoid disputes about who gets what. Keep in mind, however, that the executor is entitled to a fee and this can be quite expensive, especially if the division of the estate is complex.
- Place and date
- Your signature at the end of the will

Amending a will

You can change your will at any time. An amendment must always be handwritten and be signed and dated. You can also revoke a will by destroying it or replacing it with another one. To avoid misunderstandings, you should expressly state in your new will that you have revoked all your previous wills.

In a contract of succession, you can regulate the following points in particular:

You agree with a statutory heir that they will renounce their inheritance. This may be appropriate, for example, if:
- one of your children waives their right to inherit because they have already received a substantial level of financial support from you; or
- you and your wife, husband or registered partner renounce each other's inheritance shares in order to leave everything to your children. Heirs who have renounced their inheritance in a contract of succession can no longer claim their statutory entitlement after your death.

You undertake to leave all or part of your estate to your legal heirs or to a third person. For example, you can provide in the contract of succession:
- that you undertake to leave the house that you live in with the family to one of your children; or
- that you and your wife, husband, or registered partner are the sole beneficiaries of each other's estate.`

1. Download a template. Forms and specimens are available from many organisations, such as the Swiss Medical Association FMH (website available in German, French and Italian), which offers both short and full versions.
2. Complete your chosen form, then date and sign it.
3. Give your living will to a close friend or family member, or to your family doctor. You can also tell them where your treatment team can find the document if they need it.
4. Keep a note in your wallet about your living will and where it is kept.

Do not hesitate to get advice on completing the form. The doctor treating you will be able to help, for example. If decisions have to be made, a clear directive setting out your wishes carries greater weight, and raises fewer questions about what those wishes are.

Review your living will regularly and amend it if necessary. The FMH recommends checking it every couple of years. Do not forget to date and sign the new version.

Your employer is obliged to provide you with a salary certificate each year and usually sends it to you before the end of January. If you had more than one job at any time or if you changed employers during the year in question, you will receive a certificate for each job.

The salary certificate is the most important document you need for completing your tax return. In several cantons, employers have to send a copy directly to the tax authorities. As an employee, you only need to attach a salary certificate to your tax return if you work for an employer outside your canton or if required by the competent tax authority.`,
